# Ebaybot

This Ebaybot uploads the products you want to sell for you. This project was meant to work around spending money on keeping the products higher in the search list. Usually you need to pay a fee to get your Products back up, but you can find a work around. Everytime when you upload a product, the most recent will be listed higher. So now you can choose, either you pay the fee or you reupload your product. I prefer the second option. After a while this might be get annoying, so I decided to programm this bot.

# How does it work?

open the "UserUI.py" file and fill in the information. When you are done, just press the go button and you can leave the script do it's magic. It usually takes around 5 min. 

__Attention__: This script only supports one Path for the product picture. This will hopefully change later on. 

# Potential

I intended to make this script an standalone script. So it deletes and uploads Products on it's own in specific time periods. This may be something which will also follow later on.
